# rickandmortyApi

This is an website built with bootsrap using apis by dom manipulation toshow the characters of rick and morty

In this readme I'll show my road to build this

The api is https://rickandmortyapi.com/api

The road is ended, it took me some time, but I'm proud of this solo project, next one will be a plugin, so for now I ended this project domaining the dom manipulation, JS asyncronous, data structures, and api manipulation
